### Project Overview

 The project is about predicting the mutual fund returns in terms of bond spread


### Problem Statement ###

The data given is of the mutual funds in USA. The objective of this problem is to predict the ‘basis point spread’ over AAA bonds i.e. feature ‘bonds_aaa’ against each Serial Number.

Basis Point Spread indicates the additional return a mutual fund would give over the AAA rated bonds.
